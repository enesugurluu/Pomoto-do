# PomoTo-do Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Product vision
PomoTo-do delivers a unified productivity workspace that blends a Pomodoro timer with structured task and project management. The product helps independent professionals, students, and small teams plan their day, work in distraction-free cycles, and reflect on their progress with meaningful analytics.

### 1.2 Problem statement
Knowledge workers currently juggle separate apps for timers, to-do lists, project tracking, and retrospectives. Constant context switching wastes time, manual tracking introduces friction, and sterile interfaces rarely adapt to personal preference. The result is inconsistent focus and an inability to maintain deep work habits.

### 1.3 Goals
- Provide one surface for planning tasks, running focus sessions, and reviewing results.
- Encourage repeatable deep work routines through guided Pomodoro flows and lightweight nudges.
- Give power users and teams premium insights, personalization, and collaboration hooks that justify a paid tier.
- Support growth with a clear marketing funnel across landing, pricing, and in-product upgrade surfaces.

### 1.4 Success metrics (initial targets)
- Activation: 70% of new accounts start a focus session and create >=1 task within the first week.
- Engagement: Average 3.5 Pomodoro sessions per active day; 60% of active users complete at least one task per session.
- Retention: 40% week-4 retention for the free tier; 20% conversion from trial to paid inside 30 days.
- Monetization: Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) >= $5k by the quarter after general launch.

## 2. Target users and personas
- **Focused Freelance Creator ("Alex")**: Designers, writers, and contractors who batch client work. Needs quick task capture, visual prioritization, and a motivating workspace.
- **Engineering Power User ("Morgan")**: Developers and product managers managing complex backlogs. Wants Pomodoro tracking tied to projects, granular analytics, and integrations.
- **Academic Achiever ("Riley")**: Students balancing coursework and study blocks. Values streaks, reminders, and a calm interface that works across devices.
- **Team Lead ("Jordan")** *(stretch persona)*: Small team manager seeking lightweight visibility into team workloads, project health, and upgrade value.

## 3. Key user journeys
1. **Plan the day**: Review dashboard highlights -> skim project status -> drill into task list -> capture or edit tasks with priorities, tags, due dates, and Pomodoro estimates -> assign to projects.
2. **Run a focus session**: Open the Pomodoro timer -> select an active task -> tweak durations in quick settings if needed -> enter focus mode -> complete the cycle -> log the session toward task and daily stats -> queue the next block.
3. **Track progress**: Visit the dashboard -> scan quick stats, streaks, and contribution heatmap -> (Pro) compare projects and peak productivity windows -> identify adjustments.
4. **Personalize the workspace**: Open settings -> adjust Pomodoro defaults, notifications, sounds, and theme -> generate or save a custom theme -> update profile details.
5. **Evaluate upgrade**: Hit a gated feature (analytics, leaderboard, premium theme) -> view the upgrade modal with plan options -> start a trial or close -> log telemetry for follow-up.
6. **(Future) Collaborate as a team**: Switch to shared projects -> assign tasks to teammates -> review team contribution and project status -> coordinate next focus blocks.

## 4. Functional scope

### 4.1 Core experience
- **Pomodoro Timer (app/pomodoro, components/pomodoro-timer.tsx)**
  - Work, short-break, and long-break modes with adjustable durations, auto-start toggles, and saved long-break cadence.
  - Focus mode that hides navigation, expands the timer, and emphasizes progress feedback.
  - Session stats covering completed Pomodoros, total sessions, and task progress, plus celebratory states for streaks.
  - Quick settings dialog for on-the-fly adjustments to duration, sound, auto-start, and theme selection.
  - Active task sidebar with priority badges, Pomodoro progress, and a manage tasks shortcut.
- **Task management (app/tasks, components/task-management.tsx)**
  - Create, edit, complete, and delete tasks with title, description, priority, project, tags, due date, Pomodoro estimate, and optional image.
  - Search, filtering (status, project, overdue), and sorting (due date, priority, created, title).
  - Dialog-driven creation/editing with previews for uploaded images and tag chips.
- **Project workspace (app/projects, components/projects-content.tsx)**
  - Project cards with progress percentage, completed versus total tasks, Pomodoros spent, due dates, and team roster.
  - Status and priority badges, overdue or due-soon labels, and space for quick actions like archive.
  - Filters for status/priority/search plus dialog scaffolding for new or edited projects (requires real data hookup).
- **Productivity dashboard (app/page.tsx, components/dashboard-content.tsx)**
  - Overview tab with greeting, quick stats, current goals, upcoming focus blocks, streak cards, and motivational content.
  - Contribution heatmap and trend widgets to visualize time investment; Pro analytics and social tabs gated by plan.
  - Developer mode toggle to unlock Pro-exclusive panels for testing.

### 4.2 Settings and personalization (app/settings, components/settings-content.tsx)
- Pomodoro default durations, auto-start preferences, sound toggle, and volume control persisted per user.
- Theme switcher covering light, dark, system, curated premium palettes, saved custom themes, and a random theme generator.
- Profile editor for avatar placeholder, name, bio, company, and contact info; subscription status pill.
- Notification and focus settings (sound, upcoming reminders, planned future focus aids).

### 4.3 Monetization and upgrade surface
- Tiered pricing presented on the landing page (Basic, Pro, Premium) with feature comparison.
- Upgrade modal highlighting Pro benefits: advanced analytics, global rankings, premium themes, random theme generator, advanced goals, productivity heatmaps.
- Developer mode in the sidebar to unlock Pro features for internal testing without billing.
- Future payment integration to launch trials, capture subscriptions, and enforce entitlements.

### 4.4 Marketing and acquisition
- Rich landing page (`app/landing`) with feature grid, testimonials, pricing, FAQ, and CTAs (open app, watch demo, schedule demo).
- Email capture in the footer for newsletter and launch updates.
- Navigation ready for campaigns (features, pricing, testimonials, contact anchors).

### 4.5 Out of scope for initial release
- Native mobile apps (responsive web is required instead).
- Real-time multi-user presence or synchronous editing.
- Calendar, email, or task import integrations beyond CSV export/import backlog.
- Offline-first sync or automation routines.
- AI-based task suggestions or summaries.

## 5. Non-functional requirements
- **Performance**: Timer updates must remain accurate to <250ms drift; dashboard loads in <2 seconds on standard broadband; interactions smooth on mid-range laptops and tablets.
- **Reliability**: Preserve timer state and task edits across refreshes; degrade gracefully if network requests fail; autosave form inputs.
- **Security and privacy**: Authenticated access before persisting personal data; encrypt data in transit and at rest; adhere to GDPR/CCPA for data export and deletion.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast, keyboard operable timers and dialogs, focus trapping in modals, and reduced motion preference support.
- **Internationalization**: Time-zone aware stats, localized date formatting, and copy structured for translation.
- **Device support**: Responsive layouts from 320px mobile to widescreen desktop; theme fidelity across light/dark modes.

## 6. Technical considerations
- **Architecture**: Next.js App Router with client components for interactive views and server components for future data fetching; shared context providers for theme and Pomodoro settings.
- **State and persistence**: Replace mock data with a hosted database (Supabase, Firebase, or PostgreSQL API) for users, tasks, projects, and session logs; continue using local storage only for low-risk preferences.
- **Notifications and audio**: Use Web Notifications API and HTML5 audio; respect user volume and mute settings.
- **Analytics instrumentation**: Capture session start/complete, task create/complete, upgrade modal view, theme change, and project activity events; send to Segment or a similar pipeline.
- **Payments**: Integrate Stripe or Paddle for subscriptions, trials, coupons, and invoicing; hook upgrade CTA to checkout and entitlement update.
- **Integrations roadmap**: Calendar sync (Google/Microsoft), CSV/Trello import-export, SSO for teams, webhook API for Pro tier.

## 7. Release plan and milestones
- **MVP (target: 6 weeks)**
  - Auth, persistent tasks/projects, Pomodoro timer with focus mode, settings basics, landing page, upgrade modal (informational only).
  - Analytics for activation funnel, task completion, and timer usage.
- **Pro beta (additional 4 weeks)**
  - Billing integration, premium themes, analytics tab, leaderboard, advanced settings (notifications, random theme generator), email reminders.
  - Closed beta with ~200 invitees; monitor conversion, churn, and telemetry.
- **Growth iteration (ongoing)**
  - Shared projects, mentions, improved mobile experience, integrations, marketing experiments, referral program, contextual upsells.

## 8. Risks and mitigations
- **Data sync gaps**: Timer completions and task progress must stay aligned. Use optimistic UI with reconciliation against the server.
- **Upgrade fatigue**: Overuse of upgrade prompts may feel spammy. Limit frequency, offer previews, and align prompts with real value moments.
- **Focus disruption**: Notifications or layout shifts can break concentration. Suppress non-essential UI updates in focus mode and provide a panic pause.
- **Analytics cost**: Heatmaps and historical rollups may be expensive. Batch process sessions nightly and cache aggregates for dashboard fetches.
- **Theme legibility**: User-generated palettes could fail contrast checks. Validate color combinations and fall back to safe defaults when needed.
- **Expectation mismatch**: Landing page references collaboration before it exists. Communicate roadmap status and invite interested teams to beta waitlist.

## 9. Open questions
- Which authentication strategy will we ship first (email magic link, OAuth providers, username/password)?
- What limits define the free tier (projects, tasks, Pomodoro history) before an upsell is triggered?
- Do we need real-time sync between multiple sessions or will periodic refresh suffice for MVP?
- How far do we go with notifications at launch (browser, email, mobile push)?
- Which analytics stack and retention policy fit budget and compliance goals?
- How will teams share data and permissions (role-based access control, project ownership)?

## 10. Next steps
1. Validate personas and workflows with 8-10 user interviews and concept walkthroughs.
2. Finalize data models and API contracts; estimate hosting and third-party costs.
3. Translate this PRD into an MVP backlog (Linear/Jira) with clearly scoped epics and milestones.
4. Harden the design system and premium theme tokens; audit accessibility early.
5. Draft the go-to-market plan covering beta recruitment, pricing experiment, and content calendar.
